# Running the Docker Containers

There are two options for running the Docker Containers:
1. Using Docker Compose to manage the containers for you
2. Using Docker directly to start each container

:warning: Pre-requisites :
1. Docker : last version (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)



## Building the Docker Image
The configuration for two Docker Images are provided; one image for Opentheso2 itself, and the other for a Postgres database which holds the Opentheso2 data. 

```
docker image build -t opentheso2-postgres -f Dockerfile-postgres .

docker image build -t opentheso2 .
```


## Running with Docker

A Docker Container for the Opentheso2 Posgres database must be started before starting a container for Opentheso22 itself.

```
cd opentheso2/docker

docker run --name opentheso2-db --volume opentheso2-pgdata:/pgdata --env POSTGRES_USER=opentheso --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=opentheso --env PGDATA=/pgdata opentheso2-postgres

docker run --name opentheso2 --link opentheso2-db --publish 8080:8080 -it opentheso2
```

## Accessing Opentheso2

Once the Docker Containers are running, you can access Opentheso2 in a web-browser by visiting: http://localhost:8080/opentheso2

# Restart Opentheso2
If you want to restart both containers after their shutdown, you must search the IDs with the docker command
```
docker ps -a
```
Example response:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                        PORTS                               NAMES
0e2229ff80e1   opentheso2                                "catalina.sh run"        9 minutes ago   Exited (143) 33 seconds ago                                       opentheso2
5334294a3e87   opentheso2-postgres                       "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   9 minutes ago   Exited (0) 33 seconds ago                                         opentheso2-db
```

After you need to restart the containers with the docker command
```
docker start xxxxxxx
```

# Docker Volumes

The docker volume `opentheso2-pgdata` stores the database, if you want to start with a clean slate you can remove the volume and it will be re-created. To remove the volume just run:

```
docker volume rm opentheso2-pgdata
```
